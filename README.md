# All-Sky-Distribution-in-Galactic-Coordinate-System
All Sky Distribution in Galactic Coordinate System

​

​By receiving a columned file containing Galactic latitudes and longitudes of some sources plus any other quantity, this code will plot an all-sky distribution of​ the sources in the Galactic coordinate system. The color code can be any quantity e.g. the redshift or recession velocity. 
The example is plotted using a sample of data from the HyperLeda database:http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/

It was used for the plots of this publication: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...597A.120J​
